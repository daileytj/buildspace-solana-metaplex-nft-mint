- Delete the `.cache` folder that was generated by the Metaplex CLI's candy machine commands.
- Change up your NFT files to be whatever you want!
- Run Metaplex's `upload` command via the CLI to upload the NFTs.
- Run Metaplex's `verify` command via the CLI to make sure the NFTs were uploaded.
- Run Metaplex's `create_candy_machine` command via the CLI to create a new candy machine.
- Run Metaplex's `update_candy_machine` command via the CLI to create the drop date.
- Update your `.env` file with all your new addresses.
